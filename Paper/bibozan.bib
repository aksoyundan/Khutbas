abstract="This chapter is primarily concerned with a power struggle that has been taking place within Turkey over the last two-hundred years, but in particular with the last eighty years of this struggle. Working on religion, politics, and politics of religion anywhere involves examining the various parties of the state, society, and the individuals in the political body of a given country. During the whole republican era since 1923, friction has been increasing between two groups within Turkish society that may roughly be defined as laicists1 and Islamists,2 but it has become particularly more visible since the 1990s. In this chapter, I discuss the basic and crucial questions as I perceive them: What is a capacitated democracy and how can it be achieved in the context of law and politics in Turkey? To evolve my argument, I initially focus on the development of relations among the state, groups in society, and religion in the Republic of Turkey. An examination of the Presidency of Religious Affairs, the Diyanet {\.{I}}{\c{s}}leri Ba{\c{s}}kanla{\u{g}}i forms the starting point for this. Then, I discuss the need for and possibility of finding a mutually acceptable basis for peaceful coexistence in this country. My preference to focus on the last eighty years instead of the entire two-hundred-year span of the phenomenon stems from my acceptance of republican times as a more visible stage for the above-mentioned contestation.",

    abstract = { The integration of social science with computer science and engineering fields has produced a new area of study: computational social science. This field applies computational methods to novel sources of digital data such as social media, administrative records, and historical archives to develop theories of human behavior. We review the evolution of this field within sociology via bibliometric analysis and in-depth analysis of the following subfields where this new work is appearing most rapidly: (a) social network analysis and group formation; (b) collective behavior and political sociology; (c) the sociology of knowledge; (d) cultural sociology, social psychology, and emotions; (e) the production of culture; (f) economic sociology and organizations; and (g) demography and population studies. Our review reveals that sociologists are not only at the center of cutting-edge research that addresses longstanding questions about human behavior but also developing new lines of inquiry about digital spaces as well. We conclude by discussing challenging new obstacles in the field, calling for increased attention to sociological theory, and identifying new areas where computational social science might be further integrated into mainstream sociology. }

Using a special module of the General Social Survey, I first demonstrate that religion functions as a compensatory resource for structurally disadvantaged groups—women, racial minorities, those with lower incomes, and, to a lesser extent, sexual minorities. I then demonstrate that religion—operating as both compensatory resource and values-shaping schema—suppresses what would otherwise be larger group differences in political ideology. This study provides empirical support for the general “opiate” claim that religion is the “sigh of the oppressed creature” and suppressor of emancipatory political values. I expand and refine the theory, however, showing how religion provides (1) compensatory resources for lack of social, and not just economic, status, and (2) traditional-values-oriented schemas that, rather than just distracting people, shape their politics in accordance with the content of religious belief systems.}",

In addition to redlining and restrictive housing covenants, housing advertisements included explicit racial language until 1968. Since then, housing patterns have remained racialized, despite overt forms of racial language and discrimination becoming less prevalent. In this paper, we use Structural Topic Models (STM) and qualitative analysis to investigate how contemporary rental listings from the Seattle-Tacoma Craigslist page differ in their description based on neighborhood racial composition. Results show that listings from White neighborhoods emphasize trust and connections to neighborhood history and culture, while listings from non-White neighborhoods offer more incentives and focus on transportation and development features, sundering these units from their surroundings. Without explicitly mentioning race, these listings display racialized neighborhood discourse that might impact neighborhood decision-making in ways that contribute to the perpetuation of housing segregation.}",

	outcomes of other decisions in the experiment. This raises two questions:
	(i) can we trust the existing belief elicitation results, (ii) can
	we avoid potential hedging confounds? Our results instill confidence
	regarding both issues. We propose an experimental design that eliminates
	hedging opportunities, and use this to test for the empirical relevance
	of hedging effects in the lab. We find no evidence for hedging, comparing
	the standard hedging-prone belief elicitation treatment to a hedging-proof
	design in a sequential prisoners dilemma game. Our findings are
	strengthened by the absence of hedging even in an additional non-belief
	elicitation treatment using a financial investment frame, where hedging
	arguably would be most natural.},
